# Sleep Disorder Prediction System

This project predicts sleep disorders such as Sleep Apnea using machine learning algorithms applied on patient health and lifestyle data.

---

## Features

- Predicts sleep disorder categories based on features like age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, occupation, and sleep habits.
- Implements three machine learning algorithms:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Compares model performances using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
- Visualizes feature importance for better interpretability.
- Provides predictions to assist early diagnosis and lifestyle recommendations.

## Dataset

- Dataset contains demographic, health, and lifestyle features linked to sleep disorders.
- Example features: Gender, Age, Occupation, BMI Category, Blood Pressure, Sleep Duration, Heart Rate, etc.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
